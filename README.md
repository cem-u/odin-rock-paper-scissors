# Rock Paper Scissors
This repository contains my assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors), where I create a rock paper scissors game using javascript. This game is played entirely in the console.
## Features
- Play against a computer.
- One match is 5 rounds.
- Tracks and displays scores for both human player and the computer.
## How to run
1. Use [this link](https://cem-u.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/) or the link in the about section to access the webpage.
2. The game will immediately prompt an answer from you, for now hit "Cancel".
3. Access the inspect mode of your browser (F12 on most browsers) and navigate to the "Console" tab.
4. Now refresh the page to initiate the prompt and play the game!
