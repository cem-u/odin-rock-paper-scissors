# Rock Paper Scissors
This repository contains my assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors), where I create a rock paper scissors game using javascript. This game is played entirely in the console.
## Features
- Play against a computer in a match of five rounds.
- The console outputs the result of each round.
- At the end of the match, total scores, as well as, a winner, or a tie, gets declared.
## How to run
1. Use [this link](https://cem-u.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/) or the link in the about section to access the webpage.
2. The game may immediately prompt an answer from you, if it does, hit "Cancel", otherwise, move to the next step.
3. Access the inspect mode of your browser (F12 on most browsers) and navigate to the "Console" tab.
4. Now refresh the page to initiate the prompt and play the game!
